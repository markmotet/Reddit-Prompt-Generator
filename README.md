# Reddit Prompt Generator
This Python program uses Reddit's API to collect the titles of submissions from the subreddit r/WritingPrompts. Using string manipulation, the titles are converted into a prompt. I intend to use these prompts for testing the auto-text completing AI [GPT-2.](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)

An online demonstration of GPT-2's capability can be found [here.](https://talktotransformer.com/)
